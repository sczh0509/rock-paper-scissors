This is my attempt at creating a rock paper scissors game as part of the odin project foundation module.

[Live Demo](https://sczh0509.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)  

## Lessons Learned  
1. to stop listening to any events, use removeEventListener() to remove the listener added previously.  
  
2. Creating a modal window with animation applied  
  
3. To generate a random index, you need to multiply the Math.random function with the length of the array and floor the result
